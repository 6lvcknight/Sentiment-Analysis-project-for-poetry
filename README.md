# Sentiment Analysis in Poetry

## Overview
This project aims to explore the unique and challenging domain of sentiment analysis within the context of poetry. Using advanced Natural Language Processing techniques, we seek to not only classify the overall sentiment of poems (positive, negative, neutral) but also delve into the intricate emotions conveyed in poetic texts. Our goal is to bridge the gap between computational linguistic methods and the rich, emotive expressions found in poetry.

## Objectives
**Sentiment Classification:** To classify the overall sentiment of poems into categories like positive, negative, and neutral.
**Emotion Detection:** To identify specific emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, etc., expressed in poetry.
**Poetic Feature Analysis:** To analyze how poetic features like meter, rhyme, and stylistic devices contribute to sentiment and emotion in poetry.

## Dataset
The dataset comprises a diverse collection of poems, spanning various styles (sonnets, haikus, etc.), epochs, and languages. This dataset has been curated through a combination of web scraping, existing literary databases, and manual compilation.

## Methology
### Preprocessing
1. Text normalization and cleaning.
2. Special handling of poetic structures like stanzas and rhymes.
### Feature Extraction
1. Traditional NLP features: N-grams, term frequency.
2. Poetry-specific features: Meter, rhyme schemes, stylistic devices.
### Model
1. Utilization of both traditional ML models and neural network approaches.
2. Implementation of transfer learning for enhanced model performance.
### Evaluation
1. Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score.
2. Use of a separate test set for unbiased evaluation.

## Application
The end product is an interactive tool that can be used by literary researchers, educators, and poetry enthusiasts to understand the emotional landscape of poems.
